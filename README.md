# 3D Printable Parts for Sonex
This repository is where I will keep (and share) 3D modeled parts for my Sonex model B aircraft kit. In some cases, they are parts that can be 3D printed and used directly with my Sonex. In other cases, they are 3D printable tools or fixtures that I used while building my Sonex. Seems like a shame to keep them for myself.

## If you decide to use anything here, you do so at your own risk. I'm building an experimental ameteur built aircraft and these parts are very much on the experimental side.
